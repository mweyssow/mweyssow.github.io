I am a researcher at the [Department of Computer Science and Operations Research](https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/) of the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/).
My current work is about the application of machine learning and natural language processing in software engineering. I am particularly interested in the relation between artificial and natural languages and how techniques traditionally used in natural language processing can be used in code and program comprehension. 

Before joining University of Montreal as an exchange student, I completed a bachelor's degree at [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/) (_Belgium_). I am currently completing my master's degree in computer science (_spec. data science_) under the supervision of [Houari Sahraoui](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~sahraouh/), [Benoît Frénay](https://bfrenay.wordpress.com/) and [Benoît Vanderose](https://directory.unamur.be/staff/bvdose). 

My main research interests include unsupervised machine learning, data analysis, natural language processing, neural language models, word embeddings, software analysis and program comprehension. I am open minded and I like to collaborate about any topic in software engineering or interdisciplinary topics.
