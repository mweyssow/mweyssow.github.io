I am a PhD Student at the [Department of Computer Science and Operations Research](https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/) of the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) and at the [University of Namur](https://wwww.unamur.be/).
My current work is about the application of deep learning and natural language processing in software engineering. I am particularly interested in the development of recommender systems that enhance a developer's user experience during programming.

Before joining the University of Montreal, I was a master's student at the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/) in computer science (_spec. data science_) under the supervision of [Benoît Frénay](https://bfrenay.wordpress.com/) and [Benoît Vanderose](https://directory.unamur.be/staff/bvdose).
During my master I made a one-year research internship at the University of Montreal with [Houari Sahraoui](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~sahraouh/) as advisor. 

My main research interests include natural language processing, deep learning, software engineering, neural language models, information retrieval and recommender systems. I am open minded and I like to collaborate about any topic in software engineering or interdisciplinary topics.
